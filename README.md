# C-_SQL_RealEstateProgram
During my undergraduate degree, I came up with the idea of developing a program for Real Estate. My group and I have developed this program for the Files and Databases course using C# and SQL. This project was divided for each of us to work on two classes. My work mainly was focused on Properties and Agents. However, I also was in charge with combined the code, clean it, test it, created the design of the pages and the deployment.
